## Research

My research interests are in numerical analysis, scientific computing (sequential and parallel), methods for interface problems in materials and fluids, Hele-Shaw flow, computational fluid mechanics, and tumor growth. 



## Personal information

Currently I'm an associate professor at [Center for Mathematical Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://mathcenter.hust.edu.cn/). I received my PhD from the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/applied-math) on 2017. My advisor was Professor [Shuwang Li](http://www.math.iit.edu/~sli/Site/Welcome.html). From 2017 to 2021, I was a postdoc in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uci.edu) at Univerisity of Califronia Irvine.
